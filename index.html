    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Divine Obi, and I am a creative professional with a strong passion for storytelling, technology, and
        helping people communicate their ideas clearly. Over the years, I have grown into several roles that complement one
        another perfectly: video editor, voiceover artist, content writer, and team leader.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey into the world of media and communication started with curiosity and a desire to learn. 
        I have always been fascinated by how a simple idea can be transformed into
        something powerful enough to inform, inspire, or influence people. That curiosity pushed me to explore video
        editing, where I discovered how much I enjoy turning raw footage into a polished and engaging story.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside video editing, I developed my skills as a voiceover artist. I specialize in delivering clear, expressive,
        and engaging female voiceovers with an exciting yet steady tone.I also enjoy writing content that is simple,
        organized, and easy to understand. I have experience writing scripts, website content, social media posts,
        documentation, and other forms of written communication.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond my creative skills, I consider myself a strong team player and leader. I enjoy working with people, sharing
        ideas, and guiding projects from start to finish. I am comfortable taking responsibility, organizing tasks, and
        helping others stay focused on the goal. I value communication, honesty, and respect in every team I work with.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also very interested in technology and how it can be used to solve real problems.I have been involved in
        projects related to education technology and student management systems, where clear communication and good user
        experience are very important.I am currently learning frontend web development and some of the courses
        that is helping me in this journey are from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank"> W3schools </a>.</p>
    <p>
        In everything I do, my goal is simple: to add value. Whether I am editing a video, recording a voiceover, writing
        content, or coordinating a project, I want the final result to truly help the person or organization I am working
        with. I am always open to learning, growing, and trying new things, and I look forward to working on more projects
        that challenge me and allow me to make a positive impact.
